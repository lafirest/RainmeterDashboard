You will need update he HWiNFO IDs included in this skin to match the IDs for your system.  To do this:
1 - ensure HWiNFO is running, with sensors and shared memory active
2 - run the included "HWiNFOSharedMemoryViewer.exe" file - you can also launch this by clicking the HWiNFO icon in the rainmeter skin
3 - find the sensor reading you need (CPU Usage for example) and get the ID at the bottom right
4 - edit the top of the HWiNFO rainmeter skin in the "HWiNFO Sensor Reading IDs" section to replace the provided ID with the ID for your system
5 - refresh the HWiNFO skin
